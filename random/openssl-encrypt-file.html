        <h3>How to encrypt a big file using OpenSSL and someone's public key</h3>

        <h4>The situation</h4>
        <p>You have a public key for someone, you have a file you want to send
        them, you want to send it securely.</p> <br/>


        <h4>Can you call them, securely chat with them, or send them an encrypted e-mail?</h4>
        <p>If you are set up to chat over <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a>
        with them or to send them an 
        <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.en.html">encrypted e-mail</a>, 
        just use that to send your file.  It'll be faster.  If you can call
        them, then call them and agree on a symmetric key.  Then just use that
        key to encrypt the file like 
        <a href="http://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/#encrypt-simple">this</a>.
        If you can't (or don't want to) do either of those, then you can follow
        this how-to.  </p><br/>


        <h4>Step 0) Get their public key</h4>
        <p>The other person needs to send you their public key in .pem format.
           If they only have it in rsa format (<i>e.g.</i>, they use it for
           ssh), then have them do:</p>
        <p class="code">openssl rsa -in id_rsa -outform pem &gt; id_rsa.pem<br/> <br/>
                        openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -outform pem &gt id_rsa.pub.pem</p>
        <p> Have them send you <i>id_rsa.pub.pem </i></p>
        <br/>

        <h4>Step 1) Generate a 256 bit random key</h4>
        <p> We need to do it in two parts because there is a limit on how much
        of a key we can encrypt at once.</p>
        <p class="code">openssl rand 128 &gt; key1.bin<br/> <br/>
                        openssl rand 128 &gt; key2.bin<br/> <br/>
                        cat key1.bin key2.bin &gt;&gt; key.bin</p><br/>

        <h4>Step 2) Encrypt all the keys</h4>
        <p class="code">
             openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key1.bin -out key1.bin.enc <br/><br/>
             openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key2.bin -out key2.bin.enc
        </p><br/>

        <h4>Step 3) Actually Encrypt our large file</h4>
        <p class="code">
             openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in SECRET_FILE -out SECRET_FILE.enc -pass file:./key.bin
        </p><br/>

        <h4>Step 4) Send/Decrypt the files</h4>
        <p>Send the <em>.enc</em> files to the other person and have them do: </p>
        <p class="code">
             openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey id_rsa.pem -in key1.bin.enc -out key1.bin <br/> <br/>
             openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey id_rsa.pem -in key2.bin.enc -out key2.bin <br/> <br/>
             cat key1.bin key2.bin &gt;&gt; key.bin <br/> <br/>
             openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in SECRET_FILE.enc -out SECRET_FILE -pass file:./key.bin
        </p><br/>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p> You should always verify the hash of the file or sign it with your
            private key, so the other person knows it actually came from you.
            The approach in this how-to will work most times if there is not a
            sophisticated man-in-the-middle adversary inbetween you and the
            person you're trying to reach.  If there is a mitm bad guy, then
            he/she could substitute the other person's public key for his/her
            own and then you're screwed.  So don't use this method if the
            government is after you, but do use it if the only thing you care
            about is the cloud e-mail provider you're using having access to
            the file you're sending.</p>
